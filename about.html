					<p> Baseball has been a passion of mine since I was a child. From playing catch in the backyard with
						my
						dad to
						attending games with friends, I have always been drawn to the sport. What I love most about
						baseball
						is the
						combination of athleticism, strategy, and teamwork that it involves. Whether you're hitting a
						home
						run or
						making a diving catch in the outfield, there's a sense of satisfaction that comes with executing
						a
						play to perfection.
						Baseball will always hold a special place in my heart, and I look forward to continuing to enjoy
						the
						sport for years to come.

				<div class="val-info">
					<p>Valorant is a free-to-play first-person shooter video game developed by Riot Games. The game is
						set
						in a near-future Earth where players take on the roles of "agents" with unique abilities, and
						participate in matches with two teams of five players each. The objective of the game is to
						plant or
						defuse a bomb or to eliminate the other team before time runs out. The game has a tactical
						focus,
						with players needing to communicate and coordinate their actions to win matches. The game
						features a
						wide range of weapons and equipment, as well as a ranking system for competitive play. Currently
						I
						am a top player in the game ranking in the top .01% of players in the North American Region. I
						have
						invested countless hours in hopes of reaching the top rank of "Radiant", but to no avail. I will
						continue to strive to reach the top where only the elite stand.</p>
